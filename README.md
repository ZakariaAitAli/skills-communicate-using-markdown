## Step 3: Add a code example

_Great job adding an image to the file :tada:_

In addition to code blocks, some code blocks should be rendered differently depending on the language, such as JavaScript or command-line text.

### Example

<pre>
```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
```
</pre>

#### How it looks

```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
```
