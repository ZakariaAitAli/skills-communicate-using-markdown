## Step 2: Add an image

_Great job adding headers to the file :sparkles:_

Let's add an image. Include descriptive text in the square brackets. This text is read aloud for people using screen readers. It's also shown at times when your image doesn't display, such as when there's a poor connection. You can see the syntax for images below:

### Example

```md
![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)
```

#### How it looks

<img alt="Image of Yaktocat" src=https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png width=400>

### :keyboard: Activity: Adding an image
